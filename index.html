        <h3>My First Blog</h3>
        <p>
            Capitalism is the most common one, along with its shadow, industrialism. We show up on behalf of the invisible hand, engaging with the market in search of profit and productivity. It begins by serving the market, but can become soulless industrialism. The work can be focused on finding a need and filling it. Or it can shift to “I’m just doing my job,” and “If I don’t do it, somebody else will…”
